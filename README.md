# Center a div

In the mini project I am trying to center a div using HTML , CSS . Here I am centerind it horizontally, vertically, or both.

Methods to Center a "div"

-> Using Flexbox – A modern and flexible way to align items in a container.

-> Using CSS Grid – A powerful layout system that allows precise control over element positioning.

-> Using position: absolute – Moves an element to the center of the page using absolute positioning.

-> Using margin: auto – A simple method for horizontal centering with block elements.

-> Each method has its own use cases and advantages. Choose the one that best suits your project’s needs.
